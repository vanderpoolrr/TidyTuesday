## [2020-08-19 - Data: Plants in Danger](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-08-18/readme.md)

This week it was about exploring the extinct plants dataset. Some initial exploration using networks but then ended with some faceted plots. Color is always an interesting thing to play around with to assist with communication of the data. [R code to generate figure](/2020818_ExtinctPlants_clean.R)

Same figure but using some of the standard color palettes. It is more difficult to ignore the part of the graph for the unknown threats/actions

## [2020-08-04 - Data: European Electricity by EU_Eurostat](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-08-04/readme.md)

Worked with making some radial barcharts comparing the imports and exports of energy. [R code to generate figure](/20200803_Energy_clean.R)

Plot design modified from [AZA Arietta's tutorial](https://www.azandisresearch.com/2019/07/19/create-a-radial-mirrored-barplot-with-ggplot/)
